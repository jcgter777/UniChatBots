# UniChatBots
This is the place where I'll be experimenting with making UniChat Bots. As of right now, I have two bots that are up on UniChat, and 5 that are in progress. 

## Bots on UniChat already (Will be edited)

### FriendlyBOT
**user**: o/

**[FriendlyBOT] waves back at user

### roomBOT
**user**: roomBot: #spam  ("roomBot: spam" works as well.)

[roomBOT]: Here's the link: https://legend-of-iphoenix.github.io/UniChatDemo/?room=spam

(**Not using the "\#\" works as well.**)
## Bots in progress

### UniChat
A bot that tells you when someone enters and leaves the room. It works, but it's not on UniChat yet. I'm trying to make a command that can deactivate the bot for certain help. 

### BanBot
You can fake ban or kick someone. It works, but it's not on UniChat. Now, I just need \_iPhoenix\_ to help me make the person *actually* become "inactive", as in their name disappears from the side bar for ~10 seconds, as a joke. (I'll make it so that if you don't want this to happen to you, that you can ask me to put in an exception.)

### jcgterBOT
Lots of different commands. Activated with "~". All errors fixed!

### DoorsCE
Taken from both jcgterBOT and DoorsCS, mainly because jcgterBOT wouldn't work. It's activated diffrently, though. This is activated with "!". All bugs fixed!

### ExpBot
Mainly for me to experiment with js and commands.
